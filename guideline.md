```
Commit Message Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to write clear and meaningful commit messages for BizChat.

Commit Message Structure

Each commit message should have a clear structure:



- `<type>`: Describes the purpose of the commit (e.g., feat, fix, refactor, docs).
- `<scope>`: Optional, specifies the part of the project the commit applies to.
- `<message>`: A brief and concise description of the changes.

Commit Message Examples

- **Feature**: `feat(components): add new chat component`
- **Bug Fix**: `fix(api): resolve issue with user authentication`

Additional Guidelines

- Keep commit messages concise and focused on a single change.
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "add," "fix," "update") in commit messages.
- Start the message with a capital letter and do not end with a period.

These guidelines are designed to enhance clarity and traceability in the project's version history.
